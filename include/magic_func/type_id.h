// Visual Studio applies some optimizations in Release mode that fold functions
// performing the same operations into the same address in memory. This violates
// the assumption of function address uniqueness and screws up the behavior of
// GetTypeId(). This should not happen since these functions have their
// addresses taken, so this could be a linker bug.
//
// The following pragma disables this function folding feature. This is the
// same as setting Linker -> Optimization -> Disable COMDAT folding.
